# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `issue_create` now accepts `customFields[]` (`name` + `value`) for required project fields such as `Stream`.
- `issue_create` inherits parent custom fields by default when `parentIssueId` is set (`inheritCustomFieldsFromParent`, default `true`); explicit `customFields` override inherited values. `State` and `Assignee` are not copied.
- `issue_create` with `parentIssueId` now creates a directed `Subtask` link to the parent (instead of setting the issue `parent` field, which does not surface subtasks in some YouTrack projects).

## [0.14.1] - 2026-07-03

### Changed
- Dependency maintenance: bumped runtime and dev dependencies to their latest compatible versions (`axios` 1.18.1, `form-data` 4.0.6, `luxon` 3.7.2, `stream-json` 3.4.0, plus `eslint` / `vitest` / `typescript-eslint` / `@types/node` 26). No change to the server's own API or behavior.
- CI: bumped `actions/checkout` to v7 and `codecov/codecov-action` to v7.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- `issue_change_type` tool — set the issue Type custom field by canonical or localized value name (e.g. `Bug` -> `Task` -> `Feature`/`Fonctionnalité`). Returns previous and new type; unknown types fail with a descriptive 400 error.
- `YOUTRACK_SILENT_COMMANDS` environment variable (boolean, default `false`) controlling whether command-based link create/delete fallbacks apply silently.

### Changed
- **Command-based link create/delete now apply non-silently by default** (was: always silent). Silent apply requires the YouTrack "Apply Commands Silently" permission; accounts without it received HTTP 403, so `issue_link_add` / `issue_link_delete` failed whenever the REST `/api/issues/{id}/links` endpoint was unavailable (e.g. on-prem instances returning 405). Set `YOUTRACK_SILENT_COMMANDS=true` to restore the previous silent behavior. Non-silent apply sends the usual YouTrack notifications.

## [0.13.3] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- `issues_search` now accepts `{` and `}` in the free-text `query` parameter. Curly braces are valid YouTrack Query Language for enclosing multi-word attribute values (`tag: {Technical debt}`, `State: {In Progress}`), and the YouTrack web UI emits them on autocomplete. The shared `YQL_FORBIDDEN` validator was split in two: `yqlIdentifierSchema` (state/type/project filter args, interpolated inside a `{...}` wrapper) still rejects braces, while `yqlQuerySchema` (the whole-expression free-text query, never wrapped) now rejects only ASCII control characters. Thanks to @duffpod (#5).

### Changed
- CI: switched Codecov upload to OIDC (dropped `CODECOV_TOKEN`).

### Security
- Bumped dependencies to patched versions to clear high-severity npm advisories: `form-data` 4.0.5 → 4.0.6 (CRLF injection, GHSA-hmw2-7cc7-3qxx), `hono` 4.12.18 → 4.12.27, `qs` → 6.15.3. Only `package-lock.json` changed (all patched versions fall within existing semver ranges); the advisories affect HTTP-transport code paths not exercised by this stdio server.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- `LICENSE` (MIT) file in repository root.
- `tsconfig.build.json` so production builds emit only `src/` + `index.ts` to `dist/` and exclude tests.
- `--version` / `-v` CLI flag in `index.ts` so smoke tests and humans can verify the installed binary without running the stdio server.

### Changed
- Reworked `prepublishOnly` to run lint, typecheck, tests, audit, and build (was: lint + test + build).
- Reworked CI: added `test:coverage` step with Codecov upload (single matrix entry), separate `audit` job, kept Node 22.x + 24.x matrix and concurrency cancellation.
- Reworked publish: split into `pre-publish-checks` (lint/typecheck/audit/test/build/smoke) and `publish` jobs, OIDC trusted publishing remains the auth path, added smoke pack-and-install of the real tarball before publishing.
- Aligned `.github/dependabot.yml` with the other MCP repos: weekly Mon 06:00 Europe/Moscow, `versioning-strategy: increase`, grouped `types`/`eslint`/`vitest`, commit prefix `chore` for npm and `ci` for GitHub Actions.
- Pinned `packageManager` to `npm@11.12.1` and added `engines.npm >=10.0.0` for parity with the rest of the suite.
- `postbuild` now copies `package.json` to `dist/package.json` so `--version` reads it from the published tarball.

### Removed
- Unused `zod-to-json-schema` devDependency.
- Redundant `dev:watch` script (duplicate of `dev`).

## [0.13.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- **`tools/list` no longer fails after the zod 3 → 4 bump** — five tool input schemas (`workitems_report*`, `workitems_*`, `issue_activities`, `users_activity`) declared `z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.date()])` for date arguments. Zod 4 throws `Date cannot be represented in JSON Schema` when the MCP SDK converts `inputSchema` for `tools/list`, so every client received an empty list and a JSON-RPC `-32603` error after `0.13.0`. `z.date()` was unreachable anyway (JSON-RPC carries strings/numbers, never native `Date`), so it has been removed from all five unions and the parameter descriptions reworded to drop the misleading "or Date object" wording.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- DX scaffolding: `.nvmrc` (Node 24), `tsconfig.base.json` shared compiler options (with full strict block).
- `src/utils/tool-annotations.ts` exports five reusable `ToolAnnotations` presets — `READ_ONLY_ANNOTATIONS`, `READ_ONLY_LOCAL_ANNOTATIONS`, `WRITE_IDEMPOTENT_ANNOTATIONS`, `WRITE_CREATE_ANNOTATIONS`, `DESTRUCTIVE_ANNOTATIONS`.

### Changed

- Major dependency bumps: `zod` 3 → 4 (`z.record(value)` → `z.record(z.string(), value)`, `.passthrough()` → `z.looseObject()`, `.default({})` → `.prefault({})` for backward semantics on schemas with required-default fields, `Object.keys(z.object(args).shape)` instead of removed `.removeDefault()`); TypeScript 5.6 → 6 (added explicit `types: ["node"]` for the new default); ESLint 9 → 10 (with `preserve-caught-error` — explicit `{ cause: err }` on rethrows).
- Enabled strict TS flags on `tsconfig.base.json`: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitOverride`. Resolved 104 emerging type errors via `| undefined` on optional interface fields, `override` modifiers, and non-null assertions on guaranteed-present indexed accesses.
- Migrated every tool registration from the deprecated `server.tool(name, description, schema, cb)` to the modern `server.registerTool(name, { description, inputSchema, annotations }, cb)`. Removes the SDK 1.10+ deprecation hint TypeScript was emitting at every registration site. All ~50 tools now declare the full `ToolAnnotations` set (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) so MCP hosts can apply the right confirmation flow without reading the description.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-06

### Breaking

- **Node.js minimum bumped to 22** — `engines.node` raised to `>=22.0.0`. Node.js 20 reached EOL on 2026-04-30 and was no longer covered by CI matrix (which ran 22.x/24.x). Users on Node 20 must upgrade.

### Security

- **Dependencies updated to clear major published advisories** — `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `^1.20.0` → `^1.29.0` (clears `GHSA-w48q-cv73-mx4w`, `GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7`, `GHSA-8r9q-7v3j-jr4g`); `axios` `^1.12.2` → `^1.16.0` (clears 16 advisories including `GHSA-43fc-jf86-j433`, `GHSA-5c9x-8gcm-mpgx`, `GHSA-pmwg-cvhr-8vh7`, `GHSA-q8qp-cvcw-x6jj`, `GHSA-pf86-5x62-jrwf`, `GHSA-6chq-wfr3-2hj9` and others); transitive cleanup via `npm audit fix` removes `flatted`, `minimatch`, `picomatch`, `js-yaml`, `ajv`, `brace-expansion` advisories. A separate moderate `ip-address` advisory (`GHSA-v2v4-37r5-5v8g`) remains transitively pulled by `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` → `express-rate-limit` and only affects unused HTML-emitting methods on the SDK side.
- **Path traversal hardening in `issue_attachment_upload`** — uploaded file paths are now resolved against `YOUTRACK_OUTPUT_DIR` and absolute / `..`-traversal segments are rejected with `UnsafePathError`, mirroring the existing safeguards on `saveToFile` / `downloadToFile`.
- **YQL injection in `issues_search`** — user-supplied literals that flow into YouTrack search queries are now properly quoted/escaped; raw concatenation has been removed.
- **SSRF mitigation in attachment URLs** — `attachment.url` is validated against the configured YouTrack base host; off-host redirects are rejected before the HTTP client follows them.
- **Local OAuth tokens stay out of `temp/`** — clarified handling so transient credentials are never written to the repo working tree.

### Fixed

- **`updateWorkItem` no longer loses data on transient failures** — previously deleted the existing record before creating the new one; if the create call failed (network/5xx) the original record was lost. Now creates the new record first and only deletes the previous one after success. If cleanup of the previous record fails, the error message contains both the new id and the orphaned id for manual reconciliation.
- **`file-download` `maxBytes` is now enforced precisely** — early-exit happens at exactly the configured byte boundary instead of one chunk later.
- **Date format consistency in YQL queries** — work-item / search filters now serialize dates the way the YouTrack API expects, eliminating off-by-one matches at day boundaries.
- **`generateWorkItemReport` handles empty periods** — when the period has no work items the report now returns an empty `days` array with zeroed totals instead of failing on undefined boundaries.
- **`streaming-client` no longer leaks sockets** — partial-file cleanup paths now also tear down the underlying HTTP socket on error / timeout / abort.
- **`streaming-client` cleanup is now awaited before rejection** — `cleanupAndReject` waits for `fsp.unlink` to complete before settling the promise, so callers (and tests) that observe the file system right after a rejection see the partial file removed.

### Performance

- **`createIssue` creates links in parallel** — when `links[]` is provided the post-creation cascade now uses `processBatch` instead of awaiting each link sequentially.
- **`filterIssuesByUserActivity` rebuilt around `Map`** — replaces O(n²) array lookups with O(n) hashed access.
- **Holidays lookup switched to `Set`** — `filterWorkingDays` and the report builder now use a `Set<string>` for holiday membership instead of an array scan.
- **`existsSync` replaced with `fs.access`** — removes synchronous filesystem calls from hot paths.

### Changed (internal)

- **`YoutrackClient` split into `base.ts` + 13 domain mixins** — `src/youtrack-client/index.ts` shrank from a 3397-line monolith to a 33-line mixin assembler. New domain files: `attachments.ts`, `users-projects.ts`, `articles.ts`, `comments.ts`, `stars.ts`, `state.ts`, `links.ts`, `core.ts`, `batch.ts`, `activities.ts`, `issue-search.ts`, `workitems.ts`. `YoutrackClientBase` exports the shared HTTP/cache/utility surface that every mixin depends on.
- **Unified `createToolHandler` across all MCP tools** — every tool registration now goes through the same factory; common zod fragments (`saveToFile`, `format`, `briefOutput`) are shared.
- **Lint pipeline tuned** — `parserOptions.projectService` (lazy TS Language Service) replaces eager project loading and `eslint --cache` is enabled. Cold lint now uses ~210 MB instead of >4 GB; warm runs are seconds.
- **Typed `$type` discriminators for YouTrack entities** and a single `customFieldsWithEvents` constant remove duplicated literal lists.
- **`searchIssuesByUserActivityStrict` pipeline deduplicated** — strict and simple variants now share the same builder.

### Added

- **`format` npm script and `.editorconfig`** for consistent editor / formatter behavior.
- **CI**: `npm test` step and `timeout-minutes: 20` on publish / CI jobs.
- **Tests**: `nock.disableNetConnect()`, explicit `testTimeout`, vitest pool limits.
- **Dependabot** configuration; clearer error when `YOUTRACK_*` config is missing or invalid.
- **Project Structure** section in README plus `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Migration Notes

- Verify your runtime is Node.js ≥ 22 before upgrading.
- If you import from `src/youtrack-client/index.ts` directly (not the public `dist/` API), update imports — the file is now an assembler; types live in `base.ts` and the per-domain mixin files.
- File paths passed to `issue_attachment_upload` must now be relative to `YOUTRACK_OUTPUT_DIR` (or absolute paths within it). Paths containing `..` segments are rejected.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-05

### Breaking

- **`processBatch` contract** — multiple rejections now propagate as `AggregateError` (single rejection still rethrown as-is). Callers that need partial-success semantics must collect results inside the job and not throw.
- **Path safety for file outputs** — `saveToFile` and `downloadToFile` paths are resolved against the new `YOUTRACK_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable; absolute paths and `..` traversal segments are now rejected with `UnsafePathError`.
- **`workitem_delete` and `issue_link_delete`** require an explicit `confirmation: true` literal (mirrors the existing `issue_attachment_delete` guard).
- **Pagination** — read tools now expose explicit `limit`/`skip` parameters that are forwarded as `$top`/`$skip` on the server. Aggregated count fields renamed from `total` to `returned` to clarify per-page semantics. Default page size is 100 (max 200).
- **Tool responses** — `structuredContent` branch is no longer emitted; all responses are JSON-encoded text content via `toolSuccess`/`toolError`.

### Added

- **`YOUTRACK_OUTPUT_DIR`** environment variable for file outputs (defaults to current working directory).
- **`issue_status` / `issues_status`** lightweight state lookup tools backed by a new `getIssueState` client method.
- Public client API: `searchIssues`, `searchArticles`, `getBaseUrl`, `getOutputDir` so other modules can compose YouTrack queries without touching internals.
- HTTP timeouts and redirect/body limits in the YouTrack client.
- Single-flight caching for `listProjects` and `listLinkTypes` to deduplicate concurrent calls.
- `issue_activities` accepts `categories[]` and applies `$top`/`$skip` on the server.
- All read tools now describe themselves with the AGENTS.md Purpose / Use cases / Parameter examples / Response fields / Limitations template.

### Fixed

- **URL safety** — every path segment derived from issue codes, comment ids, attachment ids, login or project shortName goes through `encodeURIComponent`; id-like inputs are validated by regex schemas in `src/utils/validators.ts`.
- **`resolveIssueId`** is now applied consistently to mutations and bulk getters (`createIssueComment`, `updateIssue`, `changeIssueState`, `starIssue`/`unstarIssue`, `getIssues`, etc.).
- **Streaming JSONL** download via `stream-json` with proper partial-file cleanup on error/timeout/abort.
- **`deleteIssueLink`** falls back to `linkToDelete.issue.idReadable` when `targetId` is not provided (subtask removal).
- **`normalizeError`** whitelists error details (`error`, `error_description`, `message`, `code`) instead of forwarding raw payloads to clients.
- **Tool descriptions** brought to a consistent compact template across all 50+ tools.
- Anchored work-item date regex to `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$`; replaced `Math.max(...dates)` with a reduce to avoid spread-arg limits.

### Migration Notes

- Set `YOUTRACK_OUTPUT_DIR` if your tooling previously relied on absolute or traversal paths in `filePath`/`downloadPath`.
- Update wrappers around `processBatch` to handle `AggregateError`.
- Add `confirmation: true` to clients that call `workitem_delete` or `issue_link_delete`.
- Read tools that aggregated multiple pages must walk pagination via `limit`/`skip` and consume the `returned` field.
